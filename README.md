#### Description

Have you ever been bothered by not remembering where you had put all your stuff? It is dreadful having to dig into the pile of containers every time you wanted to find a tiny little thing.

myStuff is here to help! You can create a storage plan based on the setup of your household, then create stock items before allocating them to the storage container. After that, you could search for the items as and when you need it! Saves you lots of time trying to figure out if your stationery item is buried in the giant box in the corner of the tank room!

## Register and Log In

Each user needs to register for a username and use a password to log into the application.

## Creating Storage Plan

The storage plan is set up as following:

- House
- Room
- Furniture
- Container

Stock items would be attached at container level.

## Creating Stock Items

Users can create stock items that are identifiable to themselves, using stock item names, descriptions, categories to better organise.

In order to allocate stock items, users need to specify the containers where the items will be placed.

## View stock register

After storage plan is set up and stock items allocated to their containers, you could view the complete stock register in the stock register view.

There is a search function within the stock register view, where you could enter the name of stock item you wish to find to obtain the search result.

When clicked into the stock item info, not only the stock information will be displayed but also the location. Users could also click into the location to view what other items are stored in that container.
